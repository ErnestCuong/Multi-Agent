[GENERAL HOSPITAL KNOWLEDGE]
Months have a seasonal pattern of utilization, 
Feb is a short month, December can be vacation period with lower utilization, rebounds are expected in following months.
The number of surgeries is proportional to the number of Outpatient first visits, though there is a good time lag between them
The higher the inpatient BOR the longer the admission wait time from ED, the relationship is exponential
A healthy BOR is around 90%, if above 100% it means temporary beds are being used.
Quality criteria: Door to Balloon time among AMI patients should be less than 60 minutes
Quality criteria: Hip fracture to surgery time should be less than 48 hours for better outcomes
Electives are planned care, we target to reach 15% Electives. 
There is new initiative to reach this target, but it would be longer term process of addressing clinical capacity and attracting patients going elsewhere.
Medical at Home - This bring inpatient care to the comfortable environment of the home of the patient. 
It is a key government initiative to reduce institution inpatient hospitalizations, and should increase in volume where clinically feasible. 
This is a service at early stages and we expect fluctuations, but higher volume is the target.

Trend vs random fluctuations: Fluctuations are expected, those within +/- 3% are statistical and should be need not be alerted. 
So only analyze and comment on trends (increase or decrease over several months) have to be alerted. State a quantitative evidence for any trend.
